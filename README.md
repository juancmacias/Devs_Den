Dev's Den is a marketplace specialized in developer-related employment. Aimed at both companies looking for qualified personnel and developers looking for new opportunities, our marketplace is positioned as a meeting point in the vast world of technological development.<br>

The name "Dev's Den" highlights the essence of the project, with "Dev" being an abbreviation of "Developer" and "Den" referring to a meeting place, a virtual meeting point for these professionals. <br>

Our motto is: "Develop, learn and succeed in Dev's Den", emphasizing the professional growth, constant learning and success that developers can achieve in our platform. <br>

- **Ad**: Represents content posted by companies and developers looking for jobs. It includes details about the position offered (for employers) and the candidate's profile (for employees).

- **Advanced Search**:<br>
    Search by specific job characteristics, such as skills, required experience, contract type, location, etc.
    Free text search to find keywords in ads.
